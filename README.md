# Party Graphql

Research about the Epic's non-documented Graphql API for Fortnite, that is mainly used in their app.
Navigate to the docs folder.

## NPM Package
You can view the package by click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/partygrap).

## Bugs
I am aware of some operations showing as no variables, this is due to the code I made in 2 hours, so it'll probably be fixed easily.

## Endpoints
| URL | DIRECTORY | CUSTOM |
| - | - | - |
| https://graphql.epicgames.com | partyhub/graphql | None |
| https://cdn2.unrealengine.com | Kairos/data | avatars.json |

## Inspiration
I got inspiration from MixV2's reserach about a different part of the api, [check it out!](https://github.com/MixV2/EpicResearch)
