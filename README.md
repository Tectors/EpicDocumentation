# EpicGraphql

Research about the Epic's non-documented Graphql API.
Navigate to the docs folder.

## NPM Package
You can view the package by click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/partygrap).

## Usage
[I used Terbau's gist to make the account folder and parsed it, so check him out!](https://gist.github.com/Terbau/f36990a1d608f65645206835e708d488)

## Bugs
I am aware of some operations showing as no variables, this is due to the code I made in 2 hours, so it'll probably be fixed easily.

## Endpoints

## Inspiration
I got inspiration from MixV2's reserach about a different part of the api, [check it out!](https://github.com/MixV2/EpicResearch)
